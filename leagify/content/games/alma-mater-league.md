The Alma Mater league is one of the longest running Leagify Leagues. It runs based off of data generated by the NFL Draft.

"Coaches" pick schools, which have athletes.  Those athletes are drafted in the NFL draft.  Those draft picks correspond to a value chart created by Leagify.  Bonus points are provided for picks that are the result of a trade, which adds a little variance to the game.  The highest scoring coach at the end of the NFL Draft is the winner.  This game runs once per year, corresponding to the NFL draft.
