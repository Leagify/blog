Welcome to the (new) Leagify site!

Leagify was created at StartupWeekend Green Bay, partially inspired by a fantasy Winter Olympics game played by members of a local coworking space.

One of the first Leagify games was the a league based on the NFL Draft, based on drafting alma maters instead of the individual players.

Some of the charts from the original alma mater leagues were posted to the web via [Azure Websites](http://draftcharts.azurewebsites.net/), using [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) and [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) as visualization tools.

Original discussions occured on an instance of [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), but discussions have since moved to a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagify/).

Drafts started on [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), but then moved to an online draft that was originally hosted on [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/).
