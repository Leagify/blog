Welcome to the draft charts section!  Read this to figure out how to read charts, as well as how to make charts of your own.

Generally, charts make selecting teams easier, especially if those teams are something that you've just invented.

When you're creating a game, what you're looking to do is this:

You are making a _LEAGUE_ that picks _PLAYERS_ who have _POSITIONS_ and play on _TEAMS_. The _LEAGUE_ is filled up with multiple _COACHES_, each drafting a certain number of _PLAYERS_. Often, _PLAYERS_ will be sorted into different types of _POSITIONS_ to create differenitaing value between them. The _COACH_ then decides on the most valuable _PLAYERS_ to fill the required _POSITIONS_ on their _TEAMS_.

If you're trying to build a league from scratch, think of the bounds of your game. A game needs a beginning and an end, as well as a way to determine the winner.  Usually a winner is the person that has the most points, but you could try to get fancy and go for the least points.

Enter, the draft charts:

When creating a chart, think of what purpose you are trying to fill, and what information you are trying to convey.  Are you showing the most valuable _PLAYERS_?  Are you showing the difference in value between the different _POSITIONS_?  Are you trying to determine how many players should be on each _TEAM_?  Are you showing historical data, or predictions from subject matter experts in the subject area? Make sure that your chart helps inform your decisions, as well as helping potential _COACHES_.  Try to keep in mind that some _COACHES_ will research the data extensively before selecting, but others may use a more "fly by the seat of their pants" style of strategy.  Try to make charts that serve both purposes.
