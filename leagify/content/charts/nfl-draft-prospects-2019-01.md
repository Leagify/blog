Some observations from this chart:

* Alabama leads the way, which is pretty much the default at this point.
* Florida is nipping on Alabama's heels, though.  The front-seven talent there has put it way up the charts, up to second most in value.
* Clemson has a good draft class, but the rest of South Carolina looks pretty meager.
* The state of Texas has 11 different schools with potentially draftable prospects, led by Ed Oliver, but the lack of top end value keeps it from the top spot.
* Both Iowa and Iowa State have some good prospects, making Iowa a better state than usual this year.
* Montana and most of New England appear to be barren of talent, but Massachusetts seems to be punching above its weight class with some excellent talent.
* Hawaii has two low end prospects, meaning I can't leave if off the chart this year.

The rough methodology used for the Leagify charts is this: Each prospect is given a point value based on their current rank, which is given regardless of position ("Big Board" style).

Rank values:

* 01 - 10   : 35 points
* 11 - 25   : 30 points
* 26 - 35   : 25 points
* 36 - 59   : 20 points
* 60 - 70   : 15 points
* 71 - 100  : 10 points
* 101 - 120 : 8 points
* 121 - 150 : 7 points
* 151 - 180 : 6 points
* 181 - 250 : 5 points
* 251 - 300 : 2 points
* 301 - 400 : 1 point

These big board rankings came from [DraftTek's Big Board](https://www.drafttek.com/Top-100-NFL-Draft-Prospects-2019.asp), which was last updated March 9, 2019. Only the value of the player's primary position was considered.

The data is scraped, cleaned, and mushed together with a variety of code, which is available [here](https://github.com/Leagify/colly-draft-prospects) for viewing, if you're into that sort of thing.
