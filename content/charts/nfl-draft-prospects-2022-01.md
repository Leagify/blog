2022 is fast approaching!  Are you thinking about the draft yet?

Without further ado, let's see some charts!
These charts are filterable. You can see the values overall, or by conference. It looks best if you maximize the charts using the button on the lower right.

I started getting ranks on July 19, 2021, and the most recent ranks are from December 31, 2021. Here is a chart showing how each player's rank has changed during this time. This chart is a logarithmic scale, since moving 5 spots in the top 10 is a big deal, but moving 5 spots in the top 400 isn't.

On the second chart, it's a bit confusing until you select one of the individual schools or players, then you can see the individual movement of that player over the time that these rankings have been tabulated. Take a look at Spencer Rattler from Oklahoma or Aidan Hutchinson to see how the values can change. You can also select a school, and view all of the school's prospects at the same time.

The third chart just shows all of the players and all their ranks over time.

The rough methodology used for the Leagify charts is this: Each prospect is given a point value based on their current rank, which is given regardless of position ("Big Board" style).

Rank values:

* 01 - 10   : 35 points
* 11 - 25   : 30 points
* 26 - 35   : 25 points
* 36 - 59   : 20 points
* 60 - 70   : 15 points
* 71 - 100  : 10 points
* 101 - 120 : 8 points
* 121 - 150 : 7 points
* 151 - 180 : 6 points
* 181 - 250 : 5 points
* 251 - 300 : 2 points
* 301 - 500 : 1 point

These big board rankings came from [NFL Mock Draft Database 2022 Consensus Big Board](https://www.nflmockdraftdatabase.com/big-boards/2022/consensus-big-board-2022), which started posting 2022 prospect information quite a while ago, and the most current rankings are from December 31st. Only the value of the player's primary position was considered.

The data is scraped, cleaned, and mushed together with a variety of code, which is available [here](https://github.com/Leagify/prospect-scraper-mddb-2022) for viewing, if you're into that sort of thing.
